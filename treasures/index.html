The world would be a better place if more people read this book.</div><blockquote><p>He asked his students to write a paper on any problem in physics that interested them, and told them that he would give them all the highest mark, so that the bureaucrats would have something to write on their forms and lists. To his surprise a good many students came to him to complain. They wanted him to set the problems, to ask the right questions; they did not want to think about questions, but to write down the answers they had learned. And some of them objected strongly to his giving everyone the same mark. How could the diligent students be distinguished from the dull ones? What was the good in working hard? If no competitive distinctions were to be made, one might as well do nothing.</p><p>“Well, of course,” Shevek said, troubled. “If you do not want to do the work, you should not do it.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Surely freedom lay rather in openness than in secrecy, and freedom is always worth the risk.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“But what,” Oiie said abruptly, as if the question, long kept back, burst from him under pressure, “what keeps people in order? Why don’t they rob and murder each other?”</p><p>“Nobody owns anything to rob. If you want things you take them from the depository. As for violence, well, I don’t know, Oiie; would you murder me, ordinarily? And if you felt like it, would a law against it stop you? Coercion is the least efficient means of obtaining order.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We know that there is no help for us but from one another, that no hand will save us if we do not reach out our hand. And the hand that you reach out is empty, as mine is. You have nothing. You possess nothing. You own nothing. You are free. All you have is what you are, and what you give.</p></blockquote></div></div></div><div class="treasure"><div class="vertsplash"><div><a href="/assets/treasures/archive/the_brothers_karamazov.pdf"><img alt="A picture of the cover of the book" src="/assets/treasures/splash/the_brothers_karamazov.jpg" /></a></div><div><div class="metadata"><a class="pdf" href="/assets/treasures/archive/the_brothers_karamazov.pdf">The Brothers Karamazov</a><div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a> (1880)</div></div><div class="commentary">Before this book, I had never entered a flow state through reading fiction.

This is easily the most powerful book I know.</div><blockquote><p>I would only ask the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my young man’s pure heart. Not only have I no intention of apologizing for him, of excusing and justifying his simple faith on account of his youth, for instance, or the little progress he had made formerly in the study of science, and so on and so forth, but I will do the opposite and declare firmly that I sincerely respect the nature of his heart. No doubt some other young man, who takes his heart’s impressions more prudently, who has already learned how to love not ardently but just lukewarmly, whose thoughts, though correct, are too reasonable (and therefore cheap) for his age, such a young man, I say, would avoid what happened to my young man, but in certain cases, really, it is more honorable to yield to some passion, however unwise, if it springs from great love, than not to yield to it at all.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are assured that the world is becoming more and more united, is being formed into brotherly communion, by the shortening of distance, by the transmitting thoughts through the air. Alas, do not believe in such a union of people. Taking freedom to mean the increase and prompt satisfaction of needs, they distort their own nature, for they generate many meaningless and foolish desires, habits, and the most absurd fancies in themselves. They live only for mutual envy, for pleasure-seeking and self-display. To have dinners, horses, carriages, rank, and slaves to serve them is now considered such a necessity that or the sake of it, to satisfy it, they will sacrifice life, honor, the love of mankind, and will even kill themselves if they are unable to satisfy it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>My young brother asked forgiveness of the birds: it seems senseless, yet it is right, for all is like an ocean, all flows and connects; touch it in one place and it echoes at the other end of the world. Let it be madness to ask forgiveness of the birds, still it would be easier for the birds, and for a child, and for any animal near you, if you yourself were more gracious than you are now, if only by a drop, still it would be easier. All is like an ocean, I say to you. Tormented by universal love, you, too, would then start praying to the birds, as if in a sort of ecstasy, and entreat them to forgive you your sin. Cherish this ecstasy, however senseless it may seem to people.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The centripetal force on our planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done by men, though I’ve long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from old habit one’s heart prizes them.</p></blockquote></div></div></div><div class="treasure"><div class="vertsplash"><div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkaway_(Doctorow_novel)"><img alt="A picture of the cover of the book" src="/assets/treasures/splash/walkaway.jpg" /></a></div><div><div class="metadata"><a class="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkaway_(Doctorow_novel)">Walkaway</a><div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> (2017)</div></div><div class="commentary">I read this book at just the right point in my life: I was slowly leaving the bubble in which rational-minded programmers are better at everything than everyone else really; and Walkaway completely shattered that bubble in the best possible way.

Tools for Conviviality, additional excerpts
===========================================

To formulate a theory about a future society both very modern and not dominated by industry, it will be necessary to recognize natural scales and limits. We must come to admit that only within limits can machines take the place of slaves; beyond these limits they lead to a new kind of serfdom. Only within limits can education fit people into a man-made environment; beyond these limits lies the universal schoolhouse, hospital ward, or prison. Only within limits ought politics to be concerned with the distribution of maximum industrial outputs, rather than with equal inputs of either energy or information. Once these limits are recognized, it becomes possible to articulate the triadic relationship between persons, tools, and a new collectivity. <Em>Such a society, in which modern technologies serve politically interrelated individuals rather than managers, I will call <Quotes>convivial.</Quotes></Em>

---

At present people tend to relinquish the task of envisaging the future to a professional élite. They transfer power to politicians who promise to build up the machinery to deliver this future. They accept a growing range of power levels in society when inequality is needed to maintain high outputs. Political institutions themselves become draft mechanisms to press people into complicity with output goals. What is right comes to be subordinated to what is good for institutions. Justice is debased to mean the equal distribution of institutional wares.

---

Not only has the redefinition of learning as schooling made schools seem necessary, it has also compounded the poverty of the unschooled with discrimination against the uneducated. People who have climbed up the ladder of schooling know where they dropped out and how uneducated they are. Once they accept the authority of an agency to define and measure their level of knowledge, they easily go on to accept the authority of other agencies to define for them their level of appropriate health or mobility. It is difficult for them to identify the structural corruption of our major institutions.

---

The commodity called “education” and the institution called “school” make each other necessary. The circle can be broken only by a widely shared insight that the institution has come to define the purpose. Values abstractly stated are reduced to mechanical processes that enslave men. This serfdom can be broken only by the joyful self-recognition of the fool who assumes personal responsibility for his folly.

---

What is fundamental to a convivial society is not the total absence of manipulative institutions and addictive goods and services, but the balance between those tools which create the specific demands they are specialized to satisfy and those complementary, enabling tools which foster self-realization. The first set of tools produces according to abstract plans for men in general; the other set enhances the ability of people to pursue their own goals in their unique way.

---

This unqualified identification of scientific advance with the replacement of human initiative by programmed tools springs from an ideological prejudice and is not the result of scientific analysis. Science could be applied for precisely the opposite purpose. Advanced or “high” technology could become identified with labor-sparing, work-intensive decentralized productivity. Natural and social science can be used for the creation of tools, utilities, and rules available to everyone, permitting individuals and transient associations to constantly recreate their mutual relationships and their environment with unenvisaged freedom and self-expression.

---

The railroads reflected the class societies they served simply by putting different fares on the same speed. But when a society commits itself to higher speeds, the speedometer becomes an indicator of social class. Any peasant could accompany Làzaro Càrdenas on horseback. Today only his personal staff can accompany a modern governor in his private helicopter. In capitalist countries how often you can cover great distances is determined by what you can pay. In socialist countries your velocity depends on the social importance the bureaucracy attaches to you. In both cases the particular speed at which you travel puts you into your class and company. Speed is one of the means by which an efficiency-oriented society is stratified.

---

In 1945, 32 percent of all one-family housing units in Massachusetts were still self-built: either built by their owners from foundation to roof or constructed under the full responsibility of the owner. By 1970 the proportion had gone down to 11 percent. Meanwhile, <Em>housing</Em> had been discovered as a major <Em>problem</Em>. The technological capability to produce tools and materials that favor self-building had increased in the intervening decades, but social arrangements – like unions, codes, mortgage rules, and markets – had turned against this choice.

---

The human equilibrium is open. It is capable of shifting within flexible but finite parameters. People can change, but only within bounds. In contrast, the present industrial system is dynamically unstable. It is organized for indefinite expansion and the concurrent unlimited creation of new needs, which in an industrial environment soon become basic necessities.

---

The re-establishment of an ecological balance depends on the ability of society to counteract the progressive materialization of values. Otherwise man will find himself totally enclosed within his artificial creation, with no exit. Enveloped in a physical, social, and psychological milieu of his own making, he will be a prisoner in the shell of technology, unable to find again the ancient milieu to which he was adapted for hundreds of thousands of years. The ecological balance cannot be re-established unless we recognize again that only persons have ends and that only persons can work toward them. Machines only operate ruthlessly to reduce people to the role of impotent allies in their destructive progress.

---

Many more people are against cars than are against driving them. They are against cars because they pollute and because they monopolize traffic. They drive cars because they consider the pollution created by one car insignificant, and because they do not feel personally deprived of freedom when they drive. It is also difficult to be protected against monopoly when a society is already littered with roads, schools, or hospitals, when independent action has been paralyzed for so long that the ability for it seems to have atrophied, and when simple alternatives seem beyond the reach of the imagination. Monopoly is hard to get rid of when it has frozen not only the shape of the physical world but also the range of behavior and of imagination. Radical monopoly is generally discovered only when it is too late.

---

There are two ranges in the growth of tools: the range within which machines are used to extend human capability and the range in which they are used to contract, eliminate, or replace human functions. In the first, man as an individual can exercise authority on his own behalf and therefore assume responsibility. In the second, the machine takes over – first reducing the range of choice and motivation in both the operator and the client, and second imposing its own logic and demand on both. Survival depends on establishing procedures which permit ordinary people to recognize these ranges and to opt for survival in freedom, to evaluate the structure built into tools and institutions so they can exclude those which by their structure are destructive, and control those which are useful. Exclusion of the malignant tool and control of the expedient tool are the two major priorities for politics today.

---

Above all, political discussion is stunned by a delusion about science. This term has come to mean an institutional enterprise rather than a personal activity, the solving of puzzles rather than the unpredictably creative activity of individual people. Science is now used to label a spectral production agency which turns out better knowledge just as medicine produces better health. The damage done by this misunderstanding about the nature of knowledge is even more fundamental than the damage done to the conceptions of health, education, or mobility by their identification with institutional outputs. False expectations of better health corrupt society, but they do so in only one particular sense. They foster a declining concern with healthful environments, healthy life styles, and competence in the personal care of one’s neighbor. Deceptions about health are circumstantial. The institutionalization of knowledge leads to a more general and degrading delusion. It makes people dependent on having their knowledge produced for them. It leads to a paralysis of the moral and political imagination.

---

Large institutions can quite suddenly lose their respectability, their legitimacy, and their reputation for serving the public good. It happened to the Roman Church in the Reformation, to Royalty in the Revolution.

They are still aims and ends, but there is no rational agency authorized to appraise and link them to an objective reality. Endorsed by venerable historical documents, they may still enjoy a certain prestige, and some are contained in the supreme law of the greatest countries. Nevertheless, they lack any confirmation by reason in its modern sense. Who can say that any one of these ideals is more closely related to truth than its opposite? According to the philosophy of the average modern intellectual, there is only one authority, namely, science, conceived as the classification of facts and the calculation of probabilities. The statement that justice and freedom are better in themselves than injustice and oppression is scientifically unverifiable and useless. It has come to sound as meaningless in itself as would the statement that red is more beautiful than blue, or that an egg is better than milk.” [M. Horkeimer, <i>Eclipse of Reason</i>, 1947]</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>It may be that social services such as welfare could have been administered by humans exercising human judgment if the dispensing of such services were organized around decentralized, indigenous population groupings, such as neighborhoods and natural regions. But the computer was used to automate the administration of social services and to centralize it along established political lines. If the computer had not facilitated the perpetuation and “improvement” of existing welfare distribution systems — hence of their philosophical rationales — perhaps someone might have thought of eliminating much of the need for welfare by, for example, introducing negative income tax. The very erection of an enormously large and complex computer based welfare administration apparatus, however, created an interest in its maintenance and therefore in the perpetuation of the welfare system itself. And such interests soon become substantial barriers to innovation even if good reasons to innovate later accumulate. In other words, many of the problems of growth and complexity that pressed insistently and irresistibly for response during the postwar decades could have served as incentives for social and political innovation. An enormous acceleration of social invention, had it begun then, would now seem to us as natural a consequence of man’s predicament in that time as does the flood of technological invention and innovation that was actually stimulated.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is a widely held but a grievously mistaken belief that civil courage finds exercise only in the context of world-shaking events.

The exercise can lead to greater confidence about the ability to choose a cognitive style that suits the problem. Analysis of “mechanical thinking” and how it is different from other kinds and practice with problem analysis can result in a new degree of intellectual sophistication. By providing a very concrete, down-to-earth model of a particular style of thinking, work with the computer can make it easier to understand that there is such a thing as a “style of thinking.” And giving children the opportunity to choose one style or another provides an opportunity to develop the skill necessary to choose between styles. Thus instead of inducing mechanical thinking, contact with computers could turn out to be the best conceivable antidote to it.

Mindstorms, Additional Excerpts
===============================

Our culture is relatively poor in models of systematic procedures.
Until recently there was not even a name in popular language for programming,
let alone for the ideas needed to do so successfully.
There is no word for "nested loops" and no word for the double-counting bug.
Indeed, there are no words for the powerful ideas computerists refer to as "bug" and "debugging."

Without the incentive or the materials to build powerful, concrete ways to think about problems involving
systematicity, children are forced to approach such problems in a groping, abstract fashion.

---

The ethic of school has rubbed off too well. What we see as a good
program with a small bug, the child sees as "wrong," "bad," "a mistake."
School teaches that errors are bad; the last thing one wants to do is
to pore over them, dwell on them, or think about them. The child is glad
to take advantage of the computer’s ability to erase it all without any
trace for anyone to see. The debugging philosophy suggests an opposite
attitude. Errors benefit us because they lead us to study what
happened, to understand what went wrong, and, through understanding, to
fix it. Experience with computer programming leads children more
effectively than any other activity to "believe in" debugging.

---

Robert, a seventh grader, expressed his conversion to this style of programming by exclaiming:
"See, all my procedures are mind-sized bites." Robert amplified the metaphor by comments such as:
"I used to get mixed up by my programs. Now I don’t bite off more than I can chew." He had met a powerful idea:
It is possible to build a large intellectual system without ever making a step that cannot be comprehended.
And building with a hierarchical structure makes it possible to grasp the system as a whole,
that is to say, to see the system as "viewed from the top."

---

But I was painfully aware that some people who could not under-
stand the differential could easily do things I found much more dif-
ficult. Slowly I began to formulate what I still consider the funda-
mental fact about learning: Anything is easy if you can assimilate
it to your collection of models. If you can’t, anything can be pain-
fully difficult.

---

What an
individual can learn, and how he learns it, depends on what models
he has available. This raises, recursively, the question of how he
learned these models. Thus the "laws of learning" must be about
how intellectual structures grow out of one another and about how,
in the process, they acquire both logical and emotional form.

---

The computer can be a mathematics-speaking and an alphabetic-speaking entity. We are learning
how to make computers with which children love to communicate.
When this communication occurs, children learn mathematics as a
living language. Moreover, mathematical communication and alphabetic communication are thereby both transformed from the
alien and therefore difficult things they are for most children into
natural and therefore easy ones. The idea of "talking mathematics"
to a computer can be generalized to a view of learning mathematics
in "Mathland"; that is to say, in a context which is to learning
mathematics what living in France is to learning French.

It is generally
assumed that children cannot learn formal geometry until well into
their school years and that most cannot learn it too well even then.
But we can quickly see that these assumptions are based on ex-
tremely weak evidence by asking analogous questions about the
ability of children to learn French. If we had to base our opinions
on observation of how poorly children learned French in American
schools, we would have to conclude that most people were incapa-
ble of mastering it.

---

And in teaching the
computer how to think, children embark on an exploration about
how they themselves think. The experience can be heady: Thinking
about thinking turns the child into an epistemologist, an experience
not even shared by most adults.

Imagine that children were
forced to spend an hour a day drawing dance steps on squared pa-
per and had to pass tests in these "dance facts" before they were al-
lowed to dance physically. Would we not expect the world to be full
of "dancophobes"? Would we say that those who made it to the
dance floor and music had the greatest "aptitude for dance"? In
my view, it is no more appropriate to draw conclusions about math-
ematical aptitude from children’s unwillingness to spend many
hundreds of hours doing sums.

---

The children can see perfectly well that the teacher does not like
math any more than they do and that the reason for doing it is sim-
ply that it has been inscribed into the curriculum. All of this erodes
children’s confidence in the adult world and the process of educa-
tion. And I think it introduces a deep element of dishonesty into
the educational relationship.

Children perceive the school’s rhetoric about mathematics as
double talk. In order to remedy the situation we must first ac-
knowledge that the child’s perception is fundamentally correct. The
kind of mathematics foisted on children in schools is not meaning-
ful, fun, or even very useful.
