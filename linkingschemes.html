            <h2><a id="preliminaries" href="#preliminaries">Preliminaries</a></h2>
        <p>With this book, I aim to teach the basics of theoretical computer science to readers with little or no prior background in mathematics or formal computer science. If you can compute $2 + 4$ without too much effort, you should be okay in terms of prerequisites. In particular, I do not expect you to have a background in programming.</p>
<p>Theoretical computer science is a large field, and a book that extensively covers every topic that can be considered essential would make quite a daunting read. Instead, I focus on imparting a solid foundation of skills and knowledge on which you can then build as you choose. This requires a certain formal rigor, but learning this material is a rewarding and enjoyable process nonetheless.</p>
<p>So what exactly <em>is</em> theoretical computer science? Here is a simple explanation that not only exposes my personal biases but that also gives you a good idea of what content to expect from this book: Theoretical computer science applies deductive reasoning — a technique for generating knowledge from assumptions using a simple set of rules — to tricky questions such as the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What is computation?</li>
                    <li>Can the difficulty of computational tasks be meaningfully described and compared?</li>
                    <li>Can every computational problem be solved?</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is infinity?</li>
                    <li>Can the magnitude of infinite objects be meaningfully described and compared?</li>
                    <li>Can a brain of finite capacity obtain knowledge about infinitely many objects?</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is knowledge?</li>
                    <li>Can everything be known?</li>
                    <li>Can all knowledge be computed?</li>
                </ul>
<p>If you find these questions interesting, and are curious about how mathematicians have approached them over the last century, you will probably enjoy learning theoretical computer science. The learning process consists mostly of finding patterns and solving problems, both very rewarding and fun activities. Although of course a certain perseverance is needed, as the majority of time is spent failing to do so.</p>
<p>Knowledge of theory further allows to communicate very precisely and efficiently with other computer scientists. There is a vast body of knowledge out there, but it assumes familiarity with the basic theoretical concepts. This book cannot comprehensively cover all the topics if touches upon, it does however constitute a self-contained, didactic tool designed to unlock your access to the large reservoir of available knowledge.</p>
<p>The book is divided into chapters, each covering material for roughly one or two traditional university lectures. They are structured to provide suitable units of reading for a weekly or biweekly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom" class="outlink">flipped classroom</a> setting.</p>
<aside class="box programming"><div class="programmingheader"></div>
        <p>The contents of this book are not exclusively interesting to programmers, yet programmers do have certain skills and experiences which relate to the contents. I will use text elements like this one to present information tying into these skills and experiences.</p>

<section class="subsection">
            <h4><a id="sec_exercises" href="#sec_exercises">Exercises</a></h4>
        <p>A common misconception about mathematics is that of a dichtonomy between <span class="literal">getting it</span> and thus effortlessly moving through higher spheres of abstract thought, and <span class="literal">not getting it</span> and thus being unable to accomplish anything. Clever people supposedly <span class="literal">get it</span> immediately and advance their mathematical skill, whereas anyone who does not <span class="literal">get it</span> initially is doomed to stagnate. This is utterly untrue.</p>
<p>Our squishy, little monkey brains did not evolve to do mathematics; struggling with highly formal reasoning is normal, even expected. Human brains do however excel at learning new skills. You become good at mathematics the same way you become good at anything at all: practice. Hence you will find exercises throughout this book. You do not solve the exercises to check whether you understood the material, you solve the exercises so that you <em>do</em> understand the material. You will spend more time on thinking about these exercises than on reading the book.</p>
<p>To get the most out of these exercises, try to follow some principles:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Write down your solutions, you <em>will</em> miss crucial details if you do not. Giving written solutions to only some of the exercises will teach you more than solving all of them in your head.</li>
                            <li>Find other learners and talk about exercises that give you trouble. Exchange your write-ups and help each other improve them. Consider writing down solutions together.</li>
                            <li>If at all possible, gather feedback on your written solutions from a more experienced mathematician or computer scientist. Ask them to be thorough and scrutinize your work mercilessly, in content and formal rigor as well as in style and presentation. You are not only learning new concepts, you are also getting to know a new mode of communication.</li>
                        </ul>
<p>When writing down your solutions, adhere to the following guidelines:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Help your reader understand you. If the exercise asks you to either prove or disprove a statement, begin by telling the reader which of the two you will do. The reader should never need to backtrack in order to understand your solution. Omit all information that is not directly relevant to your solution.</li>
                            <li>Your reader has exactly the background knowledge given in the book up to the current point. You need to convince your reader of the correctness of your solutions. Your reader does not accept your intuitive reasoning, only knowledge derived from definitions counts. Write down computations step-by-step, annotating each step with the definition or proven statement that justifies it.</li>
                            <li>Introducing formal arguments with an intuitive explanation can sometimes increase legibility. If you choose to do so, clearly communicate which parts of your solution constitute guiding intuition and which parts constitute formal reasoning. No intuitive explanation should be without a formal counterpart.</li>
                            <li>Take notes while solving an exercise, but do not begin the final write-up until you completely solved it and you know exactly what needs writing down.</li>
                        </ul>
<p>Finally some hints for approaching difficult exercises:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>You cannot solve an exercise you do not fully understand. Whenever you encounter a term in an exercise that you are unsure about, look up its definition and insert the definition into the sentence. If necessary, use pen and paper to aid you. This book is fully hyperlinked, clicking on any term brings you to its definition. Never start an exercise if you cannot precisely define the task at hand.</li>
                            <li>Examining concrete examples often leads to ideas that are applicable in general. Rather than diving directly into a proof, first get a feeling for the behavior of specific objects. Or perhaps look for counterexamples and analyze why you just cannot find any.</li>
                            <li>Do not be discouraged if you struggle to solve an exercise. Always remember that you do not do exercises to measure your skills, but to hone them. The exercises you can easily solve are far less valuable than those you are having a hard time with. Keep in mind that moving on to another exercise and returning later to the hard one can sometimes do wonders.</li>
                        </ul>

            <h2><a id="ch_deductivereasoning" href="#ch_deductivereasoning">Deductive Reasoning</a></h2>
        <p>TODO rewrite this. This chapter covers the basic principles of deductive reasoning, the mode of thought that we will apply throughout the book. The chapter is unique in that it contains neither exercises nor real definitions, it is meant to be read once rather than being carefully worked through. Some of the material might even seem self-evident, but making it explicit initially will improve your ability to work with it. Turning implicit assumptions into explicit assumptions is an important skill to develop.</p>
<section class="section">
            <h3><a id="sec_knowledge" href="#sec_knowledge">1.1: Gathering knowledge</a></h3>
        <p><a id="deductive_reasoning" href="#deductive_reasoning" class="defined">Deductive reasoning</a> is the process of concluding facts from assumptions. If we assume that squirrels are always hungry, and that Alex is a squirrel, we can conclude that Alex is always hungry. A framework for <a href="#deductive_reasoning" class="ref">deductive reasoning</a> must provide clear rules on which deduction steps are valid. If for example we knew that Vic was always hungry, we would not be able to conclude that Vic was a squirrel; Vic could be a badger for all we know.</p>
<p>Contrast this with <a id="inductive_reasoning" href="#inductive_reasoning" class="defined">inductive reasoning</a>, the process of hypothesizing causes from observed facts. From observing that the sun rises and sets every day, you might form the potential explanation that the sun orbits the earth. Later observations might invalidate a hypothesis, but a hypothesis can never be proven beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Both <a href="#inductive_reasoning" class="ref">inductive reasoning</a> and <a href="#deductive_reasoning" class="ref">deductive reasoning</a> have their place; computer science focuses on <a href="#deductive_reasoning" class="ref">deductive reasoning</a>. Rigorous adherence to the principle that every claim has to follow from either assumptions or previously proven claims may not be a normal mode of operation for your brain, but learning to operate that way comes with a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
                            <li>Proven knowledge is permanent. It does not degrade, it does not go out of style. This has enabled mathematicians to build up knowledge over centuries.</li>
                            <li>Proven knowledge is verifiable. It does not matter who wrote a proof, whether you trust them or not. If every single step follows the deduction rules, then the resulting information is true.</li>
                            <li>Proven knowledge is inspectable. If you do not understand why something is true, the proof breaks it down for you into small, almost obviously correct steps. More often than not, the person who wrote that initially incomprehensible proof is yourself from the past. But if the proof is well written, you are always able to untangle it.</li>
                            <li>Proven knowledge is composable. Once a fact has been proven, it can be reused in further proofs. Furthermore, the details of how it was proven do not affect that reuse in any way.</li>
                        </ul>
<p>Once mastered, <a href="#deductive_reasoning" class="ref">deductive reasoning</a> enables you to think thoughts you would not have been able to think otherwise, because you would have been overwhelmed by the sheer amount of details and the accumulation of tiny errors.</p>
<aside class="box programming"><div class="programmingheader"></div>
        <p>Notice how these points are also essential for programming languages or APIs. The parallel to programming languages is particularly striking; they also provide a number of very simple basic operations, and then allow the programmer to compose them into larger structures. Even though a human brain would be unable to perform computations by executing millions of these smallest operations, programmers are still able to create such programs. Similarly, even though writing airtight proofs might seem daunting at first, you will quickly get used to it.</p>
<p>Because programs can always be broken down to simple instructions, you can debug a program when it exhibits unexpected behavior by dropping down to the lowest level and meticulously following the individual instructions. You can do the same with proofs, proofs are debuggable thought.</p>
</aside>
<p>A key property of <a href="#deductive_reasoning" class="ref">deductive reasoning</a> is that the mere form of a statement already implies how it can be proven. Suppose we want to prove that there is at least one hungry badger, how do we go about it? By presenting an actual hungry badger. How do you prove that there is at least one flying squirrel? By presenting an actual flying squirrel. If however we wanted to prove that all squirrels can fly, presenting an individual flying one would not help at all.</p>
<p>Consequently, the fewer different forms of statements there are, the less complicated the system of <a href="#deductive_reasoning" class="ref">deductive reasoning</a> becomes. In the next section, we examine a small number of constructs for forming statements, so that any statement of interest can be expressed using these constructs. The accompanying examples may feel trivial or even boring in their simplicity. That is an incredibly important and desired aspect of the system. Proving facts should not in itself be difficult; all complexity should come from the subject matter at hand, not the proof mechanism itself. Humanity has expended a great deal of collective brainpower so that the contents of the following section would become as simple as possible.</p>

<section class="section">
            <h3><a id="sec_whirlwind" href="#sec_whirlwind">1.2: A whirlwind tour of tiny proofs</a></h3>
        <p>$\newcommand{\Alex}[0]{\value{Alex}}\newcommand{\Blake}[0]{\value{Blake}}$In order to formulate statements, we first need objects that the statements can talk about. For the coming examples, we will use the natural numbers, i.e., $0, 1, 2$ and so on. Also squirrels. A squirrel by itself is not a statement; the squirrels $\Alex$ and $\Blake$ are neither true or false, but merely objects of interest. The same is true for the number $17$.</p>
<p>We can bridge into the world of statements by comparing objects for equality. Two objects are considered equal if they are identical: everything is equal to itself, but not equal to anything else.</p>
<div id="example_tour_eq" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_eq">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>1</a></h5><p>$17 = 17$</p>
<div class="proof"><p>The statement holds by assumption.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Though rather unexciting, this is our first real proof. Introducing the concept of equality would be useless if we could not immediately tell whether any two objects are equal or not. The statement is something we already know, and it turns out that proving things you already know — i.e., proving things that you assume to be true — is very easy.</p>
<p>We can make things slightly more interesting by adding <a id="informal_term" href="#informal_term" class="defined">terms</a> such as $12 + 5$ to our language of statements.</p>
<div id="example_tour_eq_term" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_eq_term">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>2</a></h5><p>$12 + 5 = 17$</p>
<div class="proof"><p>$12 + 5$ is $17$, and $17 = 17$ by assumption.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This does not add any real depth, equality of <a href="#informal_term" class="ref">terms</a> is still something that either does or does not hold by assumption. To formulate and prove more meaningful statements, we need the ability to define statements whose truth depends on the truth of other statements.</p>
<section class="subsection">
            <h4><a id="subsec_tour_quantification" href="#subsec_tour_quantification">Quantification</a></h4>
        <p><a id="informal_existential_quantification" href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="defined">Existential quantification</a> is a fancy name for stating that at least one object satisfying a certain property exists:</p>
<div id="example_tour_existential_quantification" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_existential_quantification">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>3</a></h5><p>There exists a squirrel $s$ such that $s = \Alex$.</p>
<div class="proof"><p>Define $s \defeq \Alex$, then $s = \Alex$.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You prove statements of this form by giving an object satisfying the required property. Note how two different symbols appear in the proof: <span class="literal">$=$</span> signifies a statement that is true if both sides of the sign denote the same object, whereas <span class="literal">$\defeq$</span> makes the variable on the left side denote the object on the right side.</p>
<div id="exercise_existential_quantification" class="exercise">
            <h5><a href="#exercise_existential_quantification">Exercise <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>1</a></h5><p>Prove that there exists a natural number $n$ such that there exists a natural number $m$ such that $n = m$.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercise_existential_at_least" class="exercise">
            <h5><a href="#exercise_existential_at_least">Exercise <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>2</a></h5><p>When mathematicians say <span class="literal">there is an object</span> they mean <span class="literal">there is <em>at least</em> one object</span>. Why is it not necessary to say so explicitly?</p>
</div>
<p>Besides <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">existential quantification</a> for asserting that a statement holds for at least one object, there is <a id="informal_universal_quantification" href="#informal_universal_quantification" class="defined">universal quantification</a> for asserting that a statement holds for <em>all</em> objects.</p>
<div id="example_tour_universal_quantification" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_universal_quantification">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>4</a></h5><p>For all natural numbers $n$ it holds that $n = n$.</p>
<div class="proof"><p>Let $n$ be a metro number. Then $n = n$ by assumption.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Because there are infinitely many natural numbers, we cannot prove a statement about every single number by going through all of them; we prefer our proofs to be of finite size. Instead, we prove such statements by showing that the property holds for an arbitrarily chosen object, one about which we know nothing except that it is the kind of object that the statement speaks of. This is the one and only way to prove statements of <a href="#informal_universal_quantification" class="ref">universal quantification</a>.</p>
<p>The phrase <span class="literal">Let $x$ be something.</span> is sometimes used to <em>formulate</em> statements of <a href="#informal_universal_quantification" class="ref">universal quantification</a> rather than to prove them. For example, you might write <span class="literal">Let $s$ be a squirrel. Then $s = s$.</span> instead of the wording of <a href="#example_tour_universal_quantification" class="ref">Statement&#xA0;<span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>4</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">Existential quantification</a> and <a href="#informal_universal_quantification" class="ref">universal quantification</a> allow us to define a more interesting relation between numbers than mere equality.</p>

<p>Once defined, we can formulate statements about numbers being <a href="#leq" class="ref">less than or equal to</a> other numbers.</p>
<div id="example_tour_leq" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_leq">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>6</a></h5><p>There exists a natural number $n$ such that $n \leq 17$.</p>

</div>
<p>As you can see, a definition is nothing but a shorthand; the proof proceeds by unfolding the definition and then continuing as if the body of the definition had been used rather than its shorter name. Naming recurring concepts is vital to achieving concise yet precise communication, and it can also help in clarifying thought processes. This can lead to short sentences carrying large amounts of information, but this information can always be recovered by repeatedly unfolding definitions. Remember that this book is hyperlinked, for example clicking on any <span class="literal">$\leq$</span> will take you to its definition.</p>

            <h4><a id="subsec_tour_using_quantification" href="#subsec_tour_using_quantification">Utilizing quantifications</a></h4>
        <p>Once a statement of <a href="#informal_universal_quantification" class="ref">universal quantification</a> has been proven, the acquired knowledge can be used in other proofs.</p>
<div id="example_tour_using_universal_quantification" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_using_universal_quantification">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>8</a></h5><p>$5 \leq 5$</p>
<div class="proof"><p>$5$ is a natural number. Thus by <a href="#example_tour_universal_quantification_leq" class="ref">Statement&#xA0;<span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>7</a> it holds that $5 \leq 5$.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It would not have been difficult to prove <a href="#example_tour_using_universal_quantification" class="ref">Statement&#xA0;<span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>8</a> directly, but utilizing <a href="#example_tour_universal_quantification_leq" class="ref">Statement&#xA0;<span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>7</a> saved us the trouble of finding a suitable $k$ to add to $5$.</p>
<p>Using a statement of <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">existential quantification</a> is less straightforward, because you merely know that an object satisfying a certain property exists, but you do not know anything else about that object. Thus you cannot utilize any further properties of the object in your proof.</p>
<div id="example_tour_using_existential_quantification" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_using_existential_quantification">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>9</a></h5><p>There exists a natural number $n$ such that $n \leq 18$</p>
<div class="proof"><p>By <a href="#example_tour_leq" class="ref">Statement&#xA0;<span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>6</a> there exists $n$ such that $n \leq 17$. We thus know about $n$ that there exists $k$ such that $n + k = 17$ (and this is in fact all we <em>can</em> know about $n$).</p>
<p>If $n + k = 17$, then also $(n + k) + 1 = 17 + 1$, then also $(n + k) + 1 = 18$, and then also $n + (k + 1) = 18$.</p>
<p>$k + 1$ is a natural number, so we have found a number such that $n$ plus that number is $18$, that is, we have proven that $n \leq 18$.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This proof is of course needlessly complicated, but it demonstrates how to work with this number $n$ that we know very little about. There are 18 different numbers which are possible candidates for this $n$, each of them with unique properties not shared by any other number. Most of these properties are probably completely unrelated to the proof at hand. If we worked with any specific number, we might be distracted by its properties. By working with this abstract value $n$ however, only the relevant property of being less than $17$ is available to our reasoning, which protects us from losing ourselves irrelevant details.</p>
<aside class="box programming"><div class="programmingheader"></div>
        <p>Using a statement of <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">existential quantification</a> in this manner is highly related to coding against an interface (or trait, type class, mixin, whichever the name your programming language of choice gives to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism">ad hoc polymorphism</a>) rather than against an implementation. Just like this enables you to write code that knows little about the details of the code it is interacting with, the information from a statement of <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">existential quantification</a> can be used without having to know how that statement was proven.</p>
</aside>
<p>You can argue that knowing a statement of <a href="#informal_universal_quantification" class="ref">universal quantification</a> is more useful than knowing a statement of <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">existential quantification</a>, because it can be more readily used in further proofs. This is offset by the fact that statements of <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">existential quantification</a> are much easier to prove — providing a specific example is easier than working with abstract values which can represent any number of specific values.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, you can also take on a completely opposite view. What is interesting about properties that hold for every single object there is? <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">Existential quantification</a> conveys the really useful facts, it talks about the hidden gems among the masses of uninteresting objects. Unfortunately, these statements are more difficult to prove — you need a clever idea for finding an object with the desired properties, rather than being handed an uncomplicated, distraction-free abstract value to work with.</p>

<section class="subsection">
            <h4><a id="subsec_tour_variables" href="#subsec_tour_variables">Variables</a></h4>
        <p>At this point, we should briefly discuss variables, which we have started using in terms such as <span class="literal">$n = k + 5$</span> without prior discussion. Variables can stand in for objects or terms, but they never drop out of nowhere. Every variable has to be introduced before it can appear in a proof: If we have no idea what $x$ is, how are we to determine whether $x = 6$ is true or false?</p>
<p>There is only a limited number of ways of how variables can be introduced, and we have already seen all of them:</p>
<ul>
                                    <li>Formulating <a href="#informal_universal_quantification" class="ref">universal quantifications</a>: <span class="literal">For all squirrels $s$ it holds that…</span>.</li>

                                    <li>Formulating <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">existential quantifications</a>: <span class="literal">There is a squirrel $s$ such that…</span>.</li>
                                    <li>Using <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">existential quantifications</a>: <span class="literal">Let $s$ be a squirrel such that…</span>.</li>
                                    <li>Naming terms: <span class="literal">Define $s \defeq \ldots$</span>.</li>
                                </ul>
<p>Each time you see a variable, and each time you use one yourself, it must have been introduced by exactly one of these constructs (or an equivalent wording expressing the same notion).</p>
<p>Variable introductions usually make the variable available up until the end of the current text component, e.g., until the end of the current statement, proof, (sub-)exercise, etc. That is why the example statements in this chapter quantify $n$ again and again.</p>
<aside class="box programming"><div class="programmingheader"></div>
        <p>Programming languages usually come with a set of rules that define what happens when a variable is introduced while another variable of the same name is already in scope. In our natural language proofs, we circumvent this problem by doing our reader a favor and choosing unique variable names.</p>

<section class="subsection">
            <h4><a id="subsec_tour_negation" href="#subsec_tour_negation">Negation</a></h4>
        <p>The <a id="informal_negation" href="#informal_negation" class="defined">negation</a> of a statement is a new statement that is true if the old statement is false, and vice versa. Because every statement must be either true or false, we can disprove a statement by proving its negation.</p>
<aside class="box"><div class="infoheader"></div>
        <p>Tacitly assuming that every statement has to be either true or false opens up some useful proof techniques, but it is not the only self-consistent way of thinking about statements. A different viewpoint is that of distinguishing between statements that have been proven, statements that have been disproven, and statements for which neither a proof nor a disproof are known.</p>
<p>Focusing on proveability rather than truth leads to the school of thought of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism" class="outlink">intuitionism</a>, as opposed to <span class="literal">classical mathematics</span>. To keep things compact, this book sticks consistently to classical mathematics.</p>
</aside>
<p>So how do we prove a statement of <a href="#informal_negation" class="ref">negation</a>? That depends on the kind of statement that is being negated. The easiest case is that of an equality, whose truth can be derived directly by assumption.</p>
<div id="example_tour_negation_eq" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_negation_eq">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>10</a></h5><p>It does not hold that $5 = 6$</p>
<div class="proof"><p>By assumption, $5 = 6$ does not hold, so its negation does hold.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another easy case is that of a negated <a href="#informal_negation" class="ref">negation</a>, which is simply canceled out.</p>
<div id="example_tour_negation_negation" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_negation_negation">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>11</a></h5><p>It does not hold that it does not hold that $5 = 5$</p>
<div class="proof"><p>The statement that remains after eliminating the double negation is <span class="literal">$5 = 5$</span>, which holds by assumption.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>More interesting are negations of quantifications. If a statement does not hold for all objects, then there has to exist a counterexample. In other words, we can prove the negation of a statement of <a href="#informal_universal_quantification" class="ref">universal quantification</a> by changing to <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">existential quantification</a> and moving the negation past the quantifier.</p>
<div id="example_tour_negation_universal" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_negation_universal">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>12</a></h5><p>It does not hold for all squirrels $s$ that $s = \Alex$.</p>
<div class="proof"><p>We can prove the statement by showing that there exists a squirrel $s$ such that it does not hold that $s = \Alex$. Let $s = \Blake$, then it does not hold that $s = \Alex$.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Conversely, if no object satisfying a property exists, then all objects do not satisfy that property. That is, we can prove the negation of a statement of <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">existential quantification</a> by changing to <a href="#informal_universal_quantification" class="ref">universal quantification</a> and moving the negation past the quantifier.</p>
<div id="example_tour_negation_existential" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_negation_existential">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>13</a></h5><p>It does not hold that there exists a squirrel $s$ such that it does not hold that $s = s$.</p>
<div class="proof"><p>We can prove the statement by showing that for all squirrels $s$ it does not hold that it does not hold that $s = s$. Let $s$ be a squirrel. Then $s = s$, which is exactly what remains to be proven after the double negation has been eliminated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>$\let\oldneq\neq\renewcommand{\neq}[0]{\href{##neq}{\oldneq}}$<a href="#informal_negation" class="ref">Negations</a> are usually formulated less verbosely, for example <span class="literal">It does not hold that there exist $x$ such that…</span> would normally be written along the lines of <span class="literal">There exists no $x$ such that…</span>. The <a href="#informal_negation" class="ref">negation</a> of statements of equality even has its own symbol: if $x$ and $y$ are <a id="neq" href="#neq" class="defined">unequal</a>, we write $x \neq y$.</p>

        <p>The remaining kinds of statements we still need to explore each take two other statements and express that there is some relation between the truth of these two statements.</p>
<p>A <a id="informal_conjunction" href="#informal_conjunction" class="defined">conjunction</a> states that two statements are both true:</p>
<div id="example_tour_conjunction" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_conjunction">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>14</a></h5><p>$5 = 5$ and $6 = 6$.</p>
<div class="proof"><p>$5 = 5$ holds by assumption, and $6 = 6$ holds by assumption.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As you can see, you prove a <a href="#informal_conjunction" class="ref">conjunction</a> by proving both of its parts.</p>
<p>A <a id="informal_disjunction" href="#informal_disjunction" class="defined">disjunction</a> states that out of two statements at least one is true:</p>
<div id="example_tour_disjunction_first" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_disjunction_first">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>15</a></h5><p>$5 = 5$ or $5 = 6$.</p>
<div class="proof"><p>$5 = 5$ holds by assumption, so the full statement is true.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You prove a <a href="#informal_disjunction" class="ref">disjunction</a> by proving either of its substatements. The following two examples demonstrate the remaining two constellations of substatement truth which result in a true <a href="#informal_disjunction" class="ref">disjunction</a>.</p>
<div id="example_tour_disjunction_second" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_disjunction_second">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>16</a></h5><p>$5 = 4$ or $6 = 6$.</p>
<div class="proof"><p>$6 = 6$ holds by assumption, so the full statement is true.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="example_tour_disjunction_both" class="statement">
<h5><a href="#example_tour_disjunction_both">Statement <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>17</a></h5><p>$5 = 5$ or $6 = 6$.</p>
<div class="proof"><p>$5 = 5$ holds by assumption, so the full statement is true.</p>
</div>
<p>Or alternatively:</p>
<div class="proof"><p>$6 = 6$ holds by assumption, so the full statement is true.</p>
</div>
</div>
<aside class="box programming"><div class="programmingheader"></div>
        <p>Unlike in many programming languages, it does not matter in which order the two substatements of a <a href="#informal_disjunction" class="ref">disjunction</a> appear. You can choose to prove the second one even if the first one might already be true, as demonstrated in the second proof of <a href="#example_tour_disjunction_both" class="ref">Statement&#xA0;<span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>17</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Similar to <a href="#informal_existential_quantification" class="ref">existential quantification</a>, the <span class="literal">at least</span> is often left implicit. In everyday language, <span class="literal">or</span> usually signifies an exclusive choice. In a formal context, the <a id="informal_xor" href="#informal_xor" class="defined">exclusive or</a> which denotes that both at least and at most one of two alternatives is true — i.e., <em>exactly</em> one — uses an explicit <span class="literal"><em>either</em> bla or blub</span>.</p>
<div id="exercise_informal_exclusive_or" class="exercise">
            <h5><a href="#exercise_informal_exclusive_or">Exercise <span class="chapterNumber">1.</span>5</a></h5><p>Using <a href="#informal_negation" class="ref">negation</a>, <a href="#informal_conjunction" class="ref">conjunction</a>, and <a href="#informal_disjunction" class="ref">disjunction</a>, construct a statement with the same meaning as <span class="literal">either $\Blake$ is hungry or $\Blake$ is asleep</span>.</p>
<p>Whenever you encounter an <a href="#informal_xor" class="ref">exclusive or</a>, you can prove it by translating it into the equivalent statement that only uses <a href="#informal_negation" class="ref">negation</a>, <a href="#informal_conjunction" class="ref">conjunction</a>, and <a href="#informal_disjunction" class="ref">disjunction</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that whenever the <a href="#informal_xor" class="ref">exclusive or</a> of two statements is true, then so is their <a href="#informal_disjunction" class="ref">disjunction</a>. Remember also that we assume every statement to be either true or false. From these two observations, we obtain the <a id="law_of_excluded_middle" href="#law_of_excluded_middle" class="defined">law of excluded middle</a>: we can always assume <span class="literal">Bla or not bla</span> to be true, no matter how simple or complicated of a statement <span class="literal">bla</span> is.</p>

<p>Utilizing a <a href="#informal_disjunction" class="ref">disjunction</a> to prove another statement is more difficult however, because either of its substatements might not be true.
